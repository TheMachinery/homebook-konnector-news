[Cozy][cozy] Javascript Client
==============================


What's Cozy?
------------

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy][cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.  With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.


What's cozy-client-js?
------------------

`cozy-client-js` is a javascript library made by Cozy. It enables applications (client-side apps, konnectors, OAuth apps, etc.) to make requests to the cozy stack.

cozy-client-js is compatible with both cozy architectures, V2 and V3.

To learn more about cozy-stack (V3), head over to [its repository](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack).

If you are getting started on cozy application development, you should follow this [tutorial](https://dev.cozy.io/clientsideapp.html) and use the current `cozy-browser-sdk`. Transitioning from the cozy-browser-sdk library to this one should imply minimal changes (see [transition doc](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client-js/blob/master/docs/browser-sdk-transition.md))

[The reference documentation](https://cozy.github.io/cozy-client-js/) is the place to see what you can do with this lib, and how to do it!
